- **High Scores System**: Record-breaking single performance instances (highest burst damage, skill damage, single-fight DPS)
- **Glicko-2 Rating System**: Pure skill ratings with uncertainty and volatility tracking
- **Player Summary Modal**: Click any player name for detailed performance breakdowns by profession and metric
- **Profession-Specific Rankings**: Weighted leaderboards for different WvW roles with automatic build detection
- **Guild Integration**: GW2 API integration for guild member filtering and tracking
- **Time-Based Filtering**: View performance across different time periods (All Time, 30d, 90d, 180d)
- **Automated Sync**: Smart detection and processing of new combat logs
- **Static Web Interface**: Deploy anywhere with interactive sorting, filtering, and dark mode support

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: GUI Application (Recommended for beginners)
1. **Download** the executable for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/pyrogw2/GW2LeaderBoard/releases)
2. **Configure** by copying `sync_config.json.example` to `sync_config.json` and editing it
3. **Run** the executable and use the graphical interface

### Option 2: Command Line

```bash
# 1. Check for new logs and process them automatically
python sync_logs.py --auto-confirm

# 2. Or manually process existing logs
python parse_logs_enhanced.py extracted_logs/ -d gw2_comprehensive.db
python glicko_rating_system.py gw2_comprehensive.db --recalculate

# 3. Generate web interface
python generate_web_ui.py gw2_comprehensive.db -o web_ui_output

# 4. Open web_ui_output/index.html in your browser
```
